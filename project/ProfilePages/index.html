          Hi, my name is Ruairi, and I am a software engineer. I have been working in Software since 2011 but had a career in Sales and Construction before that.<br>
          In creating this website, I hope to be able to build enough skills and knowledge to transition into Front-end Development<br>
          So please take some time and have a look at what I am and have done.
        </p>

            <h3>Before I started in software</h3>
            <p>
              I was in Sales and Construction. Just before the housing crash in the 2000's I decided on a change in career and went back to college in 2006.
              Here I started with a certification in Data Networking and gained my CCNA profeshional certification.
              Fron there I went onto IT Blanchardstown where I earned a BSc(hons) in Computer Science

            <h3>After University</h3>
            <p>
              I gained employment with IBM where I became a manual Software Tester which progressed into an Software development Engineer in Test (SDET).
              For nearly 8 years work in Java and JavaScript across a number of different frameworks and platforms where I built up know knowledge around testing and coding.

            <h3>Over this time</h3>
            <p>
              I built up a passion for the process and gained a deep insght into the Agile and SCRUM methodology.
              I attended a number of training sessions and days for SCRUM and Agile but have the most passion for the Spotify SCRUM Model which I spent 4 years working in.
              During this time even though I wasnt a SCRUM Master, the team had a rolling SCRUM Master role which everyone pon the team did if they wanted it.
              I did host many of the ceramonies and meetings and acted as a driving factor in the Test team and the wider Development team.

            <h3>Along with my Day to Day duties</h3>
            <p>
              I also acted as a mentor to a number of new hires who went on to have log lasting careers and even into managment.
              I have also run a number of events including a patent day where people were encouraged to create and submit patents which had a number of events and talked over the space of a week.
              While doing all this, I tried to support the team and help those that needed it wether they just needed a hand with a piece of code or testing or needed training and teaching on the frameworks and how to write code from scratch.
